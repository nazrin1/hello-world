Hello.
My name is Nikkie.
I like programming in Java and listening to dancehall.
Often at the same time.
I'm not that great at programming.
I'm working on it though.
I'm honestly indifferent towards marmite.
There is really no need for all these facts.
I am enjoying myself though.
Because I'm typing so feels like I'm doing something but I'm acctually not.
